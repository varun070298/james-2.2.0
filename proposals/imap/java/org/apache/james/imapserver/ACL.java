 * Interface for objects representing for an IMAP4rev1 Access Control List.
 * There should be one instance of this class per open mailbox. An Access
 * control list, for IMAP purposes, is a list of <identifier, rights> pairs.
 *
 * <p>The standard rights in RFC2086 are:
 * <br>l - lookup (mailbox is visible to LIST/LSUB commands)
 * <br>r - read (SELECT the mailbox, perform CHECK, FETCH, PARTIAL, SEARCH,
 * COPY from mailbox)
 * <br>s - keep seen/unseen information across sessions (STORE SEEN flag)
 * <br>w - write (STORE flags other than SEEN and DELETED)
 * <br>i - insert (perform APPEND, COPY into mailbox)
 * <br>p - post (send mail to submission address for mailbox, not enforced by
 * IMAP4 itself)
 * <br>c - create (CREATE new sub-mailboxes in any implementation-defined
 * hierarchy)
 * <br>d - delete (STORE DELETED flag, perform EXPUNGE)
 * <br>a - administer (perform SETACL)
