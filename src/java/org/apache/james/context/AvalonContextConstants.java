/**
 * This class is a placeholder for Avalon Context keys.
 *
 * In order to decouple James from Phoenix, and to allow James
 * to run in any Avalon Framework container it is necessary that
 * James not depend on the BlockContext class from Phoenix, but
 * rather only on the Context interface.  This requires that we
 * look up context values directly, using String keys.  This
 * class stores the String keys that are used by James to
 * look up context values.
 * 
 * The lifetime of this class is expected to be limited.  At some
 * point in the near future the Avalon folks will make a decision
 * about how exactly to define, describe, and publish context
 * values.  At that point we can replace this temporary mechanism
 * with the Avalon mechanism.  Unfortunately right now that decision
 * is still unmade, so we need to use this class as a temporary
 * solution.
